## About me


I'm from Kemerovo. I started learn web technologies in December, 2019. I like it!

Managed to master HTML, CSS(SCSS), Javascript. But I haven't a code reviewer. I need a mentor.

<br>

## Example
### Task:

Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

### Solution:

<pre>
<code>
    function lovefunc(flower1, flower2) {  
        const option1 = flower1 % 2 !== 0 && flower2 % 2 === 0;
        const option2 = flower1 % 2 === 0 && flower2 % 2 !== 0;
                
        const inLove = option1 || option2
                  
        return inLove;
    }
</code>
</pre>
